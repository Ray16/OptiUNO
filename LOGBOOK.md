# Logbook

Append-only history of changes and actions. Newest entries at the bottom. Never overwrite existing entries.

## 2026-07-13

- Ran `/init`; created `CLAUDE.md` documenting project intent (tuning UNO strategy configurations via evolutionary search), external dependencies, and key references.
- Created initial `LOGBOOK.md` and `STATUS.md`.
- Finalized the `CLAUDE.md` **Rules** section with the following (user-provided):
  1. Never commit — user runs `git commit`/`git push` manually.
  2. Never modify UNO source code unless explicitly authorized; treat UNO as a read-only dependency accessed via `run-time-options`.
  3. Never modify the user's environment; only check for installed packages and suggest fixes.
  4. Stay within the `OptiUNO/` directory and subfolders; do not explore parent/sibling folders.
  5. Session logging: read `LOGBOOK.md` + `STATUS.md` at start; update both at end (LOGBOOK append-only, STATUS overwritten).

### Session 2 — CUTE benchmark scrape

- Built `scripts/scrape_cute.py`: a polite, resumable scraper for the COCONUT Library2 CUTE collection (`https://arnold-neumaier.at/glopt/coconut/Benchmark/Library2_new_v1.html`). Uses already-installed `requests`/`bs4`/`lxml`/`pandas` (no installs). Flags: `--only`, `--limit`, `--force`, `--delay`, `--summary-only`.
- Scraped **all 727** problems into `problems/CUTE/<name>/`. Per problem: downloaded every available file (`.mod`, `.gms`, `.dag`) + reference solution `RES/<name>.res`, and wrote `metadata.json` with the table metadata (number, classification, N, M, Nnl, Mnl, Nz, Fbest), per-file `*_file_available` flags, `feasible` (from the parenthesized-Fbest convention), and an `in_uno_429_subset` tag.
- Tagged UNO's benchmark subset from `nonconvex_solver_comparison/CUTE/small_instances.txt`: **425 of 429** matched; 4 subset names are absent from Library2 (`hs067`, `methanb8`, `methanl8`, `nuffield_continuum`).
- Wrote `problems/CUTE/summary.csv` (727 rows) mirroring the web table plus all metadata keys.
- Findings: `.mod` present for all 727 (the format UNO needs); `.gms` 531, `.dag` 545, `.res` 531. Missing `.gms`/`.dag`/`.res` return HTTP 300 (Apache "Multiple Choices") = genuinely absent, recorded as `false`. Feasibility: 510 true, 8 false (infeasible best-known), 209 unknown (empty Fbest). Corpus ≈128 MB / 3077 files. Verified an infeasible example (`argauss`, `hs085`), spot-checked table rows against the site, and confirmed idempotent re-run (all 727 skipped).
- Fixed two bugs during testing: table hrefs are relative to the index page (not `Library2/`) — was producing doubled URLs; and the subset-missing check now compares against the full table.

### Session 3 — `.mod` → `.nl` converter

- Built `scripts/problem_parser.py`: converts each `problems/CUTE/<name>/<name>.mod` into `<name>.nl` (AMPL
  ASCII "g"-format) in the same folder, for the UNO solver (`uno_ampl` reads `.nl`, not `.mod`). Mirrors
  `scrape_cute.py` conventions (docstring, `pathlib`, section banners, `main(argv)`, `--only/--limit/--force`,
  atomic tmp→rename, `metadata.json` read/merge/write with `indent=2`, `raise SystemExit(main())`).
- Conversion approach: `preprocess_mod()` strips AMPL *command* statements (`solve`, `display`, `print`,
  `printf`, `expand`, `close`, `shell`, `exit`, `quit`, `reset`, `write`, `csvdisplay`) after removing comments,
  keeping all model/data statements (`param`, `var`, `minimize`, `subject to`, `data;` blocks, `let` starting
  points). The cleaned model is written to a temp `.mod`, `AMPL().read()`-run (so nothing solves), then
  `write "g<stub>"` emits the `.nl`; tmp files are renamed/cleaned atomically. A single `AMPL()` instance is
  reused with `reset()` per problem and recreated only if the engine dies.
- Outputs: updates each `metadata.json` (`nl_file_available`, `files["nl"]`, `nl_conversion` status/reason) and
  refreshes `problems/CUTE/summary.csv` with `nl_file_available` + `nl_conversion_status` columns (inserted after
  `res_file_available`). `--report` writes `nl_conversion_report.csv`; `--subset-only` restricts to the UNO 429.
- Dependency: **amplpy** (AMPL Python API + processor) — the only thing that parses AMPL `.mod`. Not installed;
  the script lazy-imports it and, if absent, prints exact install commands for the `sequential_OED` env and exits
  cleanly (code 2). Demo AMPL caps model size (~300 nonlinear vars); free AMPL CE license
  (`amplpy.modules activate <uuid>` from https://ampl.com/ce) lifts it. Oversized problems fail gracefully and are
  reported (grouped as "size-limit" vs "other"; exit code non-zero only for non-size-limit failures).
- Verified without amplpy: byte-compiles, `--help` OK, import guard prints instructions + exits 2, and
  `preprocess_mod` on `hs071.mod` (keeps `let` starting point) and `rosenbr.mod` (keeps `data;` block) strips all
  solve/display/printf while preserving model+data. Full end-to-end verification (`.nl` generation +
  `uno_ampl hs071.nl preset=ipopt` → obj ≈ 17.014) is pending the amplpy install.

### Session 3 (cont.) — amplpy install, AMPL licensing, full conversion

- User installed `amplpy` 0.17.0 (Python API) via pip, then the `base` AMPL engine module
  (`python -m amplpy.modules install base`). Note: `pip install amplpy` gives only the API; the `ampl` processor
  is a separate `amplpy.modules` install (fixed the `cannot execute /x-ampl` error). Updated the script's
  INSTALL_HINT to say `install base`.
- **AMPL licensing gotcha (important):** the bundled **demo** license allows the `write` command (how we emit
  `.nl`) but caps model size (~300 nonlinear vars) — hs071 & rosenbr converted + solved in UNO under it.
  **Community Edition (CE)** removes the size cap **but blocks `write` entirely** ("AMPL CE does not allow write
  commands except during trials") — even hs071 failed after CE activation. The fix is a **full license**: user
  obtained a free **AMPL for Academics (A4A)** license (portal.ampl.com/account/ampl, academic email, no time
  limit, full functionality) and activated it via `amplpy.modules activate <uuid>` (overwrites the CE `ampl.lic`).
- With A4A active, verified `write` unblocked and cap gone: hs071 (724 B), minc44 (N=311 → 33 KB),
  mccormck (N=50000 → 3.0 MB) all converted.
- **Ran the full batch** (`problem_parser.py --report`): **727/727 converted, 0 failed** (723 new + 4 already
  present). Each problem folder now has `<name>.nl`; `summary.csv` shows `nl_file_available=True` for all 727;
  `nl_conversion_report.csv` written; no stray temp files.
- End-to-end spot-checks in UNO (`preset=ipopt`) matched Fbest: hs071→17.014, rosenbr→~0, avion2→9.468013e7,
  bqp1var→~0, denschna→~0 (all "Success").
- Generated `.nl` corpus is **209.5 MB** across 727 files (largest: `sensors.nl` 44.4 MB, `scurly30.nl` 7.8 MB).
  These are regenerable artifacts (from `.mod` via the script); left untracked pending the user's git decision
  (track vs. `.gitignore`). [Superseded below: these were the presolve-ON files, since renamed to `_presolve.nl`.]

### Session 3 (cont.) — AMPL presolve discovery + dual-variant `.nl`

- Genericized `scripts/problem_parser.py`: removed all machine-specific paths/env names
  (`/home/sdinh/anaconda3/envs/sequential_OED/bin/python`, `sequential_OED`) from the docstring and INSTALL_HINT;
  commands now use plain `python -m ...`. Also corrected the INSTALL_HINT license guidance (CE blocks `write`; use
  a full/academic license). `git add`ed the 727 `.nl` (staging only; no commit).
- **Found that AMPL presolve was silently active.** `write` runs AMPL's presolver by default
  (`option presolve 10`), which rewrites the model (fixes/eliminates vars, drops constraints). Proven on
  `aircrftb`: presolve-on → 5 vars/0 cons vs presolve-off → 8 vars/3 cons. Across the corpus, **65 of 727** models
  actually differ between the two. For a faithful UNO benchmark we want the unsimplified model.
- Renamed the existing (presolve-on) files `<name>.nl` → `<name>_presolve.nl` for all 727 via `git mv` (staged).
- Added a **`--presolve` flag** (default OFF) to `problem_parser.py`. A `variant_spec()` maps the flag to the
  AMPL `option presolve` value (0 off / 10 on), the output filename (`<name>.nl` / `<name>_presolve.nl`), and the
  metadata/summary keys. `convert_one` now emits `option presolve N;` before `write`. `update_metadata` derives
  **both** availability flags + `files[]` entries from disk (self-healing) and records per-variant conversion
  status (`nl_conversion` / `nl_presolve_conversion`). `summary.csv` gained four nl columns
  (`nl_file_available`, `nl_presolve_file_available`, `nl_conversion_status`, `nl_presolve_conversion_status`)
  after `res_file_available`; the report gained a `presolve` column.
- **Regenerated the faithful presolve-OFF `<name>.nl` for all 727** (`--force --report`): 727 converted, 0 failed.
  Now every folder has both `<name>.nl` (faithful) and `<name>_presolve.nl` (reduced). summary.csv shows
  nl_file_available=727 and nl_presolve_file_available=727; no stray temp files; re-run without `--force` skips.
- End-to-end in UNO on faithful files: hs071→17.014, aircrftb (8-var full)→Success, allinit (4/3 full)→16.706.

### Session 3 (cont.) — UNO Python driver module

- Built `scripts/uno_runner.py`: a stdlib-only Python driver that runs `uno_ampl` via `subprocess` and returns a
  structured `UnoResult`. Supports a **preset and/or custom run-time-options** together (custom options are placed
  after `preset=` so they override it, matching UNO's parse order). Mirrors the existing scripts' conventions.
- API: `run_uno(nl_path, *, preset=None, options=None, uno_bin=None, timeout=None, write_solution=False,
  capture_stdout=False, extra_args=None) -> UnoResult`. `UnoResult` carries optimization/solution status,
  objective, residuals, cpu_time, iterations, all evaluation counts, returncode, solution_file, the options used,
  and `.ok`/`.to_dict()`. Plus a CLI: `uno_runner.py <nl> --preset P --option k=v ... [--options k=v,..]
  [--uno-bin] [--timeout] [--write-solution] [--print-stdout] [--json]`.
- Binary resolution avoids machine-specific paths: `uno_bin` arg → `$UNO_AMPL_BIN` → `shutil.which("uno_ampl")`
  → clear FileNotFoundError.
- Classifier derived from UNO source (via Explore): `uno_ampl` returns exit code 0 even on failed solves and 1
  only on setup/parse errors (printing `uno_ampl failed with the following error:` to stdout), so outcome is keyed
  on the printed `Optimization status:`. Five outcomes: **solved** (Success), **budget** (Iteration/Time limit,
  User termination), **error** (Evaluation/Algorithmic error, Unknown), **failed** (exit≠0 or no summary), and
  **timeout**. Parser tolerates the box-drawing prefixes on the residual lines and the duplicated
  `Primal feasibility:` line.
- Verified all 9 cases: compile/help; preset solve (hs071→solved, 17.014); preset+custom override; custom-only
  building blocks (→budget without preset tuning); invalid value (→error, rc 0); nonexistent model (→failed);
  malformed .nl (→failed, rc 1, captured `jacdim` error); `--write-solution` (.sol written, path recorded);
  timeout on 50k-var mccormck (→timeout); and programmatic `from uno_runner import run_uno`.

### Session 4 — Crucible: ingest OpenEvolve sources + AlphaEvolve GA note

- Answered conceptual questions on AlphaEvolve vs. Bayesian optimization vs. genetic algorithms,
  and on the AlphaEvolve/OpenEvolve setup requirements, grounded in the existing crucible wiki.
  Correction learned this session: **AlphaEvolve went generally available on 2026-07-09** as a
  hosted API on Google Cloud's Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform (client-side loop: query API for
  mutated candidates → score with your local evaluator → submit scores back). Supersedes the prior
  "not publicly available" understanding (was true as of the Jan 2026 knowledge cutoff).
- **Ingested 4 OpenEvolve web sources** into crucible (`crucible ingest`, stored under
  `.crucible/sources/external/web/`): the GitHub README (`sharma2026`), and three Hugging Face
  blog posts — the intro/announcement (`sharma2025`), GPU-kernel discovery (`sharma2025`), and the
  AlgoTune study "Towards Open Evolutionary Agents" (`andthattoo2025`). Fetched via `curl`
  (web_search is blocked by GCP org policy on this project; `pandoc` not installed, so blog HTML was
  converted to text with the already-present `bs4`). No packages installed.
- **Cite-key limitation found:** crucible *derives* cite keys as firstauthor+year and does not store
  or disambiguate them, so both Sharma-2025 blogs collide on `citep:sharma2025` (one bib entry). The
  `--bibtex` flag does not override the derived key. Article→source linking is unaffected because it
  uses `SOURCE_KEYS` filename tokens (`oe_readme`/`oe_blog_intro`/`oe_blog_gpu`/`oe_blog_agents`),
  which were verified per-article with `crucible sources`. Cosmetic bibliography collision only.
- **Distilled 5 new wiki articles + 1 update:** concepts `openevolve.org` (anchor: architecture,
  config, LLM options, setup, OptiUNO mapping) and `openevolve-empirical-findings.org` (parallelism
  essential, diff-vs-rewrite by model strength, temp ≈0.4, artifacts +17%, more iterations help,
  ensembles underperform, cascade eval saves ~70%); summaries `sharma-2025-openevolve.org`,
  `sharma-2025-openevolve-gpu-kernels.org`, `andthattoo-2025-open-evolutionary-agents.org`; and a
  cross-link section added to existing `alphaevolve.org`.
- **Maintenance:** `crucible sync` + `manifest` + `index` + `lint`. Wiki grew 17→22 articles,
  17→21 concepts, 2→6 sources, 93→130 links; new topics `openevolve`, `benchmarking`, `algotune`,
  `gpu-optimization`. Lint clean of citation/link errors (remaining items are the auto-generated
  `index.org` frontmatter warnings and two optional "no dedicated article" info hints); no orphans.
  Fixed a mid-editing snag where a delete/re-ingest cycle left the GPU blog as an orphan file with no
  DB row (re-ingested cleanly). Per rules: nothing committed.

## 2026-07-14 — Merged the two `uno_runner.py` into `optiuno/uno_runner.py`

The repo had two divergent UNO drivers: `scripts/uno_runner.py` (typed `UnoResult`, binary
resolution, full field/residual parsing, CLI — but never imported by any code) and
`quickRun/harness/uno_runner.py` (plain-dict return, hard-wired bundled binary +
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, banner parsing, `DEFAULT_TIME_LIMIT`/watchdog, `log_path` — imported only
by `quickRun/harness/benchmark.py`). Merged them into a single **`optiuno/uno_runner.py`**
(built on the richer `scripts/` version) and deleted both originals.

- Folded the quickRun-only features into the `UnoResult` design: added `banner` (composed-method
  string), `problem`, `wall_time`; added `DEFAULT_TIME_LIMIT = 20.0`, a `time_limit=` option
  (also drives the default `time_limit+10` watchdog), a `log_path` writer, and automatic
  `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` wiring when the resolved binary is a self-contained release (detected by a
  `deps/` sibling of `lib/`, so it never mis-fires for system installs — no path baked into
  `optiuno`). Signature made backward-compatible with both old call styles:
  `run_uno(nl_path, options=None, *, preset=None, uno_bin=None, time_limit=None, timeout=None, ...)`.
- Callers: `quickRun/harness/benchmark.py` now imports `from optiuno.uno_runner import ...`
  (adds the repo root to `sys.path`), passes `uno_bin=external/uno/bin/uno_ampl`, and reads the
  `UnoResult` by attribute (kept the emitted per-problem key `objective_evaluations` so the
  cache/CSV schema and existing `harness/cache/*.json` stay valid). `quickRun/harness/classify.py`
  switched from dict `.get()` to `UnoResult` attributes. The four scripts that import
  `harness.benchmark` (evaluator, run_evolution, validate_presets, variance_runs) needed no
  changes. `optiuno/__init__.py` re-exports `run_uno`/`UnoResult`/`DEFAULT_TIME_LIMIT` lazily
  (PEP 562) so `python -m optiuno.uno_runner` runs without a runpy double-import warning.
- CLI moved from `python scripts/uno_runner.py ...` to `python -m optiuno.uno_runner ...`
  (also runnable as `python optiuno/uno_runner.py ...`).
- Verified: py_compile of all changed files; `from optiuno import run_uno, UnoResult,
  DEFAULT_TIME_LIMIT`; the `harness.benchmark`/`harness.classify` import chain resolves
  `optiuno`; a live solve of `hs110`/`rosenbr` against the bundled binary returns
  `outcome=solved` with `banner`/`wall_time`/`problem` populated and `classify()` →
  `solved / Feasible KKT point`; and the CLI (`-m`, script-path, `--json`, `--time-limit`)
  works with correct exit codes. (The full `benchmark`/`validate_presets` sweep still needs the
  uncommitted HS `.nl` set under `quickRun/models/`.)

---

## 2026-07-14 — Moved bundled UNO to the repo root + system-first UNO selector

Promoted the self-contained UNO v2.8.0 build from a `quickRun/`-only resource to a
project-wide one, and centralized "which uno_ampl do we run?" in a single helper.

- **Moved `quickRun/external/` → `external/`** at the repo root via `git mv` (579 files,
  ~99 MB; staged as renames so history is preserved — **not committed**, per rule). New
  bundled binary path: `external/uno/bin/uno_ampl` (with sibling `lib/` + `deps/`). No
  `.gitignore` rule shadows the new location; `quickRun/external` is fully gone from the
  index.
- **New module `optiuno/utils.py`** — the single UNO-location authority (stdlib-only):
  - `select_uno_bin(explicit=None)` — **system-first** selection: `explicit` → `$UNO_AMPL_BIN`
    → `uno_ampl` on `PATH` → bundled `external/uno/bin/uno_ampl` fallback. Returns an
    absolute path; raises `FileNotFoundError` (with guidance) only if even the bundled build
    is missing. Usability check matches the old resolver (`is_file()` + `os.access(X_OK)`).
  - `bundled_uno_bin()` / `BUNDLED_UNO_BIN` — the one place the bundled path is written
    (computed from the package location: `Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1]/external/uno/...`).
- **`optiuno/uno_runner.py`** now routes through the helper: `resolve_uno_bin()` is a thin
  wrapper over `select_uno_bin()` (keeps the public name/signature; `run_uno` and the
  `--uno-bin` CLI gain the bundled fallback for free). Dropped the now-unused `shutil` import
  and `DEFAULT_BIN_NAME` constant; `_bundled_env()` (LD_LIBRARY_PATH wiring) is unchanged —
  it derives paths from the binary's own layout, so it works at the new location. Docstrings
  and CLI help updated to state the new precedence.
- **`quickRun/harness/benchmark.py`** keeps its **bundled pin** for reproducibility (user's
  choice), but now sources it from the helper: `UNO_BIN = bundled_uno_bin()` instead of the
  hard-coded `ROOT/"external"/...`. The `run_uno(..., uno_bin=UNO_BIN)` call is unchanged, so
  cache keying is preserved.
- **`optiuno/__init__.py`** lazily re-exports `select_uno_bin`/`bundled_uno_bin` (routed to the
  right submodule via a name→module map) alongside the existing `run_uno`/`UnoResult`/
  `DEFAULT_TIME_LIMIT`; still no eager import (no runpy warning under `python -m`).
  `quickRun/CLAUDE.md` updated to note the repo-root bundle + `select_uno_bin`/`bundled_uno_bin`.
- **Verified:** py_compile of all four Python files; bundled fallback (env unset, empty PATH →
  `select_uno_bin()` returns the root bundle); system-first precedence (a fake `$UNO_AMPL_BIN`
  binary wins over bundled); a live solve of `problems/HS_model/hs071.nl --preset ipopt`
  against the bundled binary → `outcome=solved`, obj 17.01402, `cmd[0]` = root bundle (proves
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH wiring at the new location); `harness.benchmark.UNO_BIN` resolves to the root
  bundle; `grep` finds no stale `quickRun/external` refs; all lazy re-exports import and
  `python -m optiuno.uno_runner --help` runs with no RuntimeWarning. Nothing committed.

---

## 2026-07-14 — Provisioned the HS test set and moved it to `problems/HS_model/`

Context: the `quickRun/` openEvolve run failed because (a) `run_evolution.py` hard-coded
`.venv/bin/openevolve-run` but openEvolve is installed in the `sequential_OED` conda env, and
(b) `quickRun/models/nl/` was empty (the Vanderbei `.mod` sources were never committed, so
`translate_models.py` couldn't regenerate them).

- **`run_evolution.py`:** made the Claude Code CLI (subscription) the **default** backend and
  added `--api` to opt into the Anthropic API (kept `--claude-code` as a deprecated no-op).
  Replaced the hard-coded `.venv/bin/openevolve-run` with `_find_openevolve_run()`, which
  prefers the `openevolve-run` next to the running interpreter (so
  `conda run -n sequential_OED python scripts/run_evolution.py` works), then a project `.venv`,
  then PATH.
- **Test set:** populated the set by copying the 121 faithful `hs*` `.nl` files from
  `problems/CUTE/` (a COCONUT/Neumaier translation — a different provenance than the original
  Vanderbei set, so not directly comparable to the archived `results/quickRun/` numbers). Moved
  the 75 stale Vanderbei-based cache files to `quickRun/harness/cache/_vanderbei_backup/`
  (preserved, not deleted).
- **Verified the pipeline end-to-end:** baselines evaluate on the 121-problem set
  (filtersqp 0.967 / 4.14 s, ipopt 0.917 / 11.11 s) and `run_evolution.py --smoke` runs to
  completion via the Claude Code backend (exit 0). Known issue: openEvolve reported
  "No valid diffs found in response" on every smoke iteration, so no mutation occurred — the
  plumbing works but the diff-format/LLM layer needs a follow-up.

### Relocated the test set: `quickRun/models/nl/` → `problems/HS_model/`

Moved the 121-problem HS `.nl` set up to the repo root (alongside `problems/CUTE/`) and removed
the now-empty `quickRun/models/`. Because quickRun scripts set `ROOT = quickRun/` but the target
is one level up, the two live path assignments were repointed to
`ROOT.parent / "problems" / "HS_model"` (not a string swap, which would give
`quickRun/problems/...`):

- `quickRun/harness/benchmark.py` — `NL_DIR` (the sole consumer; `test_problems()` and the
  no-`.nl` RuntimeError follow via the variable). The four scripts that import
  `harness.benchmark` (evaluator, run_evolution, validate_presets, variance_runs) inherit the
  new path — no edits.
- `quickRun/scripts/translate_models.py` — `NL_DIR` and `REPORT` (`untranslatable.md`, now
  inside the test-set dir); `MANIFEST.csv` already writes inside `NL_DIR` so it travels
  automatically. Left `MOD_DIR` (`quickRun/models/mod`, the `.mod` source) unchanged — input
  and output are no longer siblings; noted in the docstring.
- Docs updated: `quickRun/CLAUDE.md` (path-convention + commands), `STATUS.md` (new
  `problems/HS_model/` entry). Config-hash cache is unaffected (keyed by options, not paths).
- Verified: `NL_DIR` resolves to `problems/HS_model` and finds 121 problems; a full preset sweep
  reproduces filtersqp 117/121 (0.967); both edited files byte-compile.

---

## 2026-07-14 — Reviewed `quickRun/` and drafted an architecture figure

- Walked the `quickRun/` implementation and mapped its modules and data/call flow:
  - `harness/` (core): `uno_runner.py` (`run_uno` — one `uno_ampl` subprocess, regex-parses
    banner/status/objective/cpu), `classify.py` (`classify` → solved/unsolved/timeout/invalid/crash
    + silent-rewrite detection by comparing the composed-method banner against requested
    ingredients), `benchmark.py` (`evaluate_config` — ThreadPool sweep over the `.nl` set, per-config
    JSON cache in `harness/cache/`, appends `results/evaluations.csv`).
  - `scripts/`: `translate_models.py` (`.mod` → AMPL `.nl`), `run_evolution.py` (baselines +
    `openevolve-run`), `validate_presets.py` (filtersqp/ipopt vs. the paper table), `variance_runs.py`
    (CPU-time noise over R reps), `plot_pareto.py` (Pareto-front figures).
  - `evolve/`: `initial_program.py` (`UNO_CONFIG` — six evolvable ingredients), `evaluator.py`
    (validate → `evaluate_config` → `combined_score`, appends `results/evolution_history.csv`),
    `config.yaml` / `config-claude-code.yaml` (openEvolve + LLM backend).
- Wrote `quickRun/docs/architecture.py` — a matplotlib helper that renders a graph-like figure of
  these modules and their edges (inputs → preprocessing → core harness → drivers → outputs, with the
  bundled `external/uno` dependency) to `quickRun/docs/architecture.png`. Documentation only; not
  part of the experiment pipeline. **Script written but not yet run** (render step was interrupted),
  so `architecture.png` is not generated yet.
- Per rules: read-only inspection; used the **system** Python 3.12 (matplotlib 3.10.3; no graphviz)
  at the user's request rather than `quickRun/.venv`. No installs or environment changes; nothing
  committed.
